Easy Sound Recorder
=============

<p>A simple sound recording app implementing Material Design.</p>

<p>This is my personal fork where I changed two things:</p>

* changed the default storage path to "/storage/sdcard1/SoundRecorder" such that files are stored to my external SD card on my Motorola Moto E (and not to the emulated SD card)
* changed the default Sampling rate to 44.1 kHz and the default Bitrate to 96000 bps for higher quality audio recording

<p>In the future I would like to have settings to change the default storage path, sampling rate and bitrate.</p>

<p>For the original app check out https://github.com/dkim0419/SoundRecorder</p>
